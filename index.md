This is the on-boarding curriculum for new Trainers. This material supports ten one-hour discussion meetings based on assigned reading from our textbook, [How Learning Works by Lovett et al.](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1373343202), as well as our [Instructor Training Curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). Completion of this series is the main step towards certification to teach Carpentries Instructor Training courses.

## Prerequisites

This curriculum targets individuals who have applied and been accepted as Carpentries Trainers. It is generally expected that learners either have extensive background in teaching or have demonstrated commitment to Carpentries teaching practices through involvement with the community. However, no particular background knowledge is necessary to participate fully in these discussions.
